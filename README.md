Hi, I’m @FelixZwickl. I'm interested in statistics, machine learning and data science in a wide application of contexts, including finance. 
I'm currently learning the fundamentals of machine learning and looking to apply what I've learned in various kaggle competitions in order to get my skills up to the next level.
